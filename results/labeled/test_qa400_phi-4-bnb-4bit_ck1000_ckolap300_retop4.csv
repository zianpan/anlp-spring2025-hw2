We’re heading back 50 years, to the origin story that jump-started the new interpretation of the musical that’s headed our way.

The album was initially banned by the BBC as sacrilegious, but consumers begged to differ. The initial recording drew from the rock ‘n’ roll world that Webber would continue to dabble in -- a rock opera was a perfect combo of his compositional passions.

What is the name of the museum that features a gallery dedicated to Charles 'Teenie' Harris's work?,,Carnegie Museum of Art,"[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://carnegiemuseums.org/carnegie-magazine/summer-2024-carnegie-magazine/a-living-archive'}, page_content='making a statement.” Later this year, museumgoers for the first time will be able to explore this vast archive with a reinstallation of Harris’ work in the Scaife Galleries. The new Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive Gallery will feature never-before-seen components of the archive, including reels of film in canisters, and prints, some in color. Visitors will even be able to view Harris’ photographic negatives, which make up the bulk of the collection. “We’re taking a more comprehensive, intentional, and creative approach to sharing and honoring the Teenie Harris Archive and how the photographer’s art has illuminated the city’s history,” says Dana Bishop-Root, the museum’s director of education and public programs, who worked with Foggie-Barnett and Curator of Photography Dan Leers, as well as a team of creatives, on the project.

Harris was a month shy of his 90th birthday when he died on June 12, 1998. But in exhibitions of his work, the artist is typically portrayed as a much younger man in his 30s—bright-eyed, with finger waves in his black hair, and sporting his signature suit and tie. For the first time, the museum will present self-portraits, some in color, of Harris as an older man.

All tell variations of Torquato Tasso 's poem Gerusalemme liberata ( Jerusalem Delivered ). Joseph Haydn ’s Armida premiered in 1784. Its libretto was taken from Antonio Tozzi 's 1775 opera Rinaldo , as amended by Nunziato Porta . A version with music by Italian composer Gioachino Rossini premiered in 1817. Yet another version, composed by Antonín Dvořák, premiered in 1904. Pittsburgh Opera is mounting a new production of Armida .

And the amount of talent available for these first local performances of Haydn’s opera is quite remarkable. Armida (Lauryn Davis) For brevity, the program’s capsulation of the 1784 opera will do nicely. “To prevent the capture of Jerusalem by the knights of the First Crusade, the Prince of Darkness has sent the enchantress Armida into the world to seduce the Christian heroes and turn them from their duty. The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida’s spell. But, to her surprise, she becomes enchanted by him as well. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. For both, duty clashes with desire. As war rages around them, will love conquer them both?” A'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://onstagepittsburgh.com/2025/01/29/pittsburgh-opera-joseph-haydns-armida'}, page_content='Pittsburgh Opera – Joseph Haydn’s ""Armida"" onStage Pittsburgh Dedicated to connecting the diverse community of theater-makers and theater-goers in the Greater Pittsburgh area Home About onStage Pittsburgh 2024-25 Season by Company Home › Our Posts › Pittsburgh Opera – Joseph Haydn’s “Armida” Pittsburgh Opera – Joseph Haydn’s “Armida” By George B Parous on January 29, 2025 • ( 0 ) “Baroque” Rarity is Being Presented With Powerful Vocal Cast in Effective Staging By George B.

As is usually the case, Antony Walker and the orchestra gave an almost seamless delivery of the opera’s beautiful orchestration.

That interdisciplinary ethos would eventually become VIA, Pittsburgh’s first audio-visual music festival. From 2010 to 2017, VIA brought in almost 1,000 different artists from diverse locations, musical genres, and artistic practices, earning a reputation for its adventurous bookings in distinctly-Pittsburgh settings.

It also made the process more accessible to those who might have been unfamiliar with the grant making process, and some of our grantees are displaying their art at a festival for the first time.” The Festival presents a unique opportunity to see the incredible work of these seven artists, some of it for the first time, and all in Downtown Pittsburgh.

There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997.

History of the CIO An enduring question—whether union organization should be based on craft (skill) or industry (workplace)—became a divisive issue at the American Federation of Labor’s 1935 convention. An industry-based resolution, which stated that “in the great mass production industries … industrial organization is the only solution,” was defeated, which prompted defection. In November 1935, representatives of eight unions announced the formation of the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO). Two more unions joined later. The AFL retaliated by suspending all 10 unions, but the CIO built momentum by organizing the key steel, rubber, and automobile industries, reaching agreements with such large corporations as U.S. Steel and General Motors . In the following year the CIO and the AFL battled for leadership of American labour, often trying to organize the same workers. John L. Lewis John L. Lewis, 1963.

Consequently, the craft unions revolted. In 1886, under the leadership of Samuel Gompers , they organized themselves as the AFL, a loose federation that remained for half a century the sole unifying agency of the American labour movement.

About 40 people clustered in a small room with shelves of clothing on one side and racks on the other. For the bulk of the press conference, Gainey stood by as advocates not directly a part of Gainey’s administration spoke in support of the mayor and against O’Connor, following a familiar strategy from the mayor that highlights diverse voices across Pittsburgh’s communities.
