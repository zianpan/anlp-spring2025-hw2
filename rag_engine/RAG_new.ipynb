We’re committed to ensuring your experience is second to none, and the safety of our stadium is essential to maintaining this experience. The policy affects the type and size of bags that are permitted into the stadium — not the items that you normally need to bring to a game. Each fan may carry in their pockets items such as keys, makeup, combs, phones, wallets, and credit cards. Fans will continue to be able to carry in blankets and jackets. Bags that are clear plastic, vinyl or PVC and do not exceed 12\" x 6\" x 12\" Official NFL team logo clear plastic tote bags are available through The Steelers Pro Shop and at all Steelers Pro Shop locations . One-gallon clear plastic freezer bag (Ziploc bag or similar) Logo on bag cannot exceed 4.5\" tall by 3.4\" wide. Small non-clear bags that do not exceed 4.5″ x 6.5″ in size, with or without a handle or strap, may be carried into the stadium. Any bag that meets this size requirement, regardless of style (e.g., fanny pack, cross-body), will be permitted entry. An exception will be made for medically necessary items after proper inspection at the gate. Diaper bags containing medically necessary items are permitted after proper inspection at the gate. Each member of a family, including children, will be able to carry an approved clear bag and a clutch purse.

Broken tree trunks and branches clutter the shady hillside behind Keith Jones' print shop in Wilkins, reminders of last June's thunderstorm that flooded Saw Mill Run below and caused $1 million in damage to the business. \"Maybe this year will be OK,\" Jones said. \"But there's going to come a point where a storm will come that will do the exact same thing. We'll have the exact conversation again, only next time I won't be lucky.\" Like other communities in the Turtle Creek Valley, Wilkins has not cleared debris from Saw Mill Run, which swelled with 4 inches of rain in two hours. The Army Corps of Engineers has a $200,000 to $500,000 improvement project scheduled, but it won't begin before August. In the meantime, Jones and thousands of others living and working along the region's 1,400 creeks wonder what's next. Record creek floods during three of the last six flood seasons caused at least $114 million of damage in Southwestern Pennsylvania, from Carnegie to Millvale to Turtle Creek. Although flooding on the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers is rare because of federal flood control efforts, experts believe it could cost as much as $50 billion to protect homes and businesses along the region's creeks. The Corps and other agencies working to solve the problem lack authority and resources to complete the job. \"It's nobody's fault,\" said John Schombert, executive director of 3 Rivers Wet Weather, a nonprofit that advises Allegheny County on water management. \"There's just no money to do a regional flood control project. ... You've got years and years of mismanagement and design problems that you've got to make up for.\" Congress gave the Corps $660,000 to make emergency repairs this spring — stabilizing stream walls and removing sediment — for Turtle Creek and tributary Thompson Run. But some residents are angry that the government reacts only after disasters. \"We've gone to every level of local government, and none of them can do anything,\" said Neal Harrison, who pressured Wilkins officials to clean Chalfont Run to protect his family's metal-spinning business, EH Schwab Co. \"They can't fix it. You can't fix it yourself. If somebody could tell us what the answer is, we've got a whole valley full of people waiting to hear it.\" Eastern suburbs hit hard The problem is acute in the eastern suburbs, especially in Wilkins, Turtle Creek and Pitcairn — the towns downstream of Monroeville. In Pitcairn, the state Department of Environmental Protection spent 14 years planning an $8 million project to correct Dirty Camp Run. The money is allocated, but 19 boreholes drilled into the streambed for surveying are the only work completed since 1996, said Pitcairn Council President Orelio Vecchio. Rep. Joe Markosek, D-Monroeville, said everyone had good intentions. \"But it has also been a textbook case of how difficult it is to get big projects like this accomplished,\" Markosek said. In the meantime, Dirty Camp Run flooded three times, including a 1997 deluge that damaged more than a fourth of Pitcairn's 1,400 homes, said Mayor Betsy Stevick. The project is under review by lawyers at the state Department of General Services, which oversees its funding, said Joe Capasso, chief of project development at the DEP's Bureau of Waterways Engineering. \"We've had political people call up, and they guaranteed us (the review) will be done by June,\" Vecchio said. \"Now I have to wait. And if it don't happen by June, then I have to raise heck. This is how things work. It's frustrating; I know it is. I would have liked to have seen shovels going outside the office two years ago, but it doesn't work that way.\" The Pitcairn project is one of the longest-lasting in the DEP's 70 years of flood-control work, Capasso said. It typically takes five to seven years for DEP to start construction after it gets a project, he said. But construction is unlikely to begin before fall 2011, said Andy Malene, a DEP senior project designer. The Pitcairn project was completely redesigned once, because borough officials objected to razing or altering Pitcairn Elementary School, which is built over the creek. Then DEP and Pitcairn — which must share the project's costs — needed to raise another $3 million. The new plan is to bury the stream in a culvert under Wall Avenue, a main road. That set off a complex, four-year effort to do final studies and get construction easements from property owners. And that process stalled in 2008 — nothing happened for a year — because the borough fired its engineer, Capasso said. \"If Pitcairn wasn't moving, something else moved ahead of it,\" he said. \"If our project would have been constructed, we don't think there would have been any flooding. That's the goal of the project.\" June's storm caused $1 million of damage to public property and damaged 200 homes, including Jennifer Williams' house on East Wall Avenue. Crumbled parts of the creek's concrete retaining walls lie in the stream across the street, she said. She and her husband bought their home in 2002 for $48,500. But, she said, \"We couldn't sell it right now to save our lives.\" \"We always knew that (another flood) was a possibility. But we were told when we bought the house that steps were taken for it to never happen again,\" Williams said. \"But here we go, it stormed and over it came. ... There was just nothing there to stop it. There was just nothing.\" Outdated data The Corps and DEP tried to address creek flooding in Southwestern Pennsylvania by spending $127 million on flood-control projects, built mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. The studies used to design the projects were conducted in the 1950s, before a population shift and resulting suburban development. The county and Corps are trying to ramp up prevention methods. County officials hired a planner last year to create a stormwater plan for the entire county, said Bob Hurley, deputy director of the county's Economic Development Department. But before that, the county failed to take a lead role in flood protection because of staff cuts in the planning department, Hurley said. State law required the county to have management plans for its 25 major watersheds by 1989. Only nine watersheds have such plans. The problem is especially complicated in Allegheny County, where major watersheds often start in neighboring counties and cover dozens of towns. \"Not much has been done,\" said Barry Newman, chief of stormwater planning at DEP. \"In any of these watersheds, you just have a huge number of municipalities involved. When I've met with the county planning office, the biggest issue confronting us was how to begin.\" County planning in general languished since the 1980s, County Executive Dan Onorato said. One of his goals was to finish the county's master plan, and when the 2004 flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan happened just nine months into his first term, watershed management became a big part of that effort, he said. \"We've got more done in the last six years than we probably had done in the last 15,\" Onorato said. \"It is a priority, but a lot of it comes down to money. Money is going to dictate how this goes.\" Any watershed plan likely will recommend relocating some homeowners and businesses in vulnerable flood plains and ending development, experts said. \"For some of these communities, these properties aren't worth very much at all,\" said David Dzombak, a professor of environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. \"So it's kind of crazy to have people living there taking hit after hit after hit. To talk about widening a creek when you have a $20,000 property sitting along it, that's a little crazy.\" After Ivan caused more than $160 million in damages across the state, the Federal Emergency Management Agency offered to buy endangered homes. It had $14 million to spend and received $40 million in requests for buyouts — a third from Western Pennsylvania. But buyouts aren't enough in areas such as Carnegie and Millvale, where the town centers sit at the ends of creeks, vulnerable to the brunt of any flash flood. There would need to be more infrastructure projects, such as ponds to hold water upstream and expansions to the channels downstream, several experts said. The Corps' Pittsburgh District suggests that the region's federal legislators create a regional watershed authority, which experts call a crucial step. A new authority, or an existing government agency, could be empowered to take direct responsibility for flooding, prioritize the neediest projects, direct limited resources and raise money for the work, experts said. \"One of the biggest things that happens in Pennsylvania are floods, but no one is really paying attention to it,\" said Rebecca Bradley, Wilkins' manager. \"We have a group of municipalities saying, 'Please help us. We're getting hit every time it rains.' But we cannot get any movement.\" Email Newsletters TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox. 1-800-909-8742 Fax (724) 779-8743 210 Wood Street Tarentum, PA 15084 © 2025 Trib Total Media | All Rights Reserved About Us About Us Advertise Career Opportunities Contact Advertising Contact Newsroom Contact Us Feedback Request Correction Resource Center Scholarship Opportunities Send Letter to the Editor Send News Tip Subscribe Subscriber Services Get the Trib Blog eFeatures Email Newsletters eTrib Facebook Home Delivery Instagram LinkedIn Marketing Minute Store Locations TribLIVE App - App Store TribLIVE App - Google Play Twitter Sections Arts & Entertainment Best of the Best Business Directory Circulars Contests Coronavirus Lifestyles Local News Obituaries Opinion Our Publications Photos Real Estate Sports Video Weather Terms of Use Cookie Settings Privacy Policy Terms of Service Top Privacy Preference Center When you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

Pittsburgh Public Schools is scrapping a performance-based pay system, giving all its teachers at least a 2 percent raise and paying its least experienced teachers as much as 15 percent more per year. The tentative changes are included in three-year contracts overwhelmingly approved Wednesday by the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, said Nina Esposito-Visgitis, the union's president. The union represents about 3,000 teachers and support staff. A little more than 2,000 members voted on the contracts, which were approved by 90 percent of teachers, 90 percent of paraprofessionals and 77 percent of technical and clerical employees. \"We really focused on the new teachers. We were falling behind other districts in terms of our starting salary,\" Esposito-Visgitis said. \"A lot of money was put at the bottom of the salary schedule because we want to attract the best and the brightest in Pittsburgh.\" Superintendent Anthony Hamlet issued a statement Wednesday night thanking \"parents, stakeholders and the larger city for their patience\" through stalled negotiations that nearly culminated in districtwide school closures. Hamlet said he expects the new contracts to help reduce teacher turnover and improve school stability. \"It's a testament to our members and to both negotiating teams that we were able to resolve things,\" Esposito-Visgitis said. \"We're glad this chapter is over.\" Six weeks ago, the state's second-largest school district was on the verge of its first strike since 1975 . Negotiations had stalled after dragging on for 19 months. Three days before the scheduled strike, union officials and district negotiators announced they had struck a deal to avert it. But they didn't discuss the agreement's details at the time. Contract details Here are some newly disclosed changes to the tentative contracts, which are set to be in effect through June 30, 2020: • Performance-based pay will end. The contract calls for the district to eliminate a pay-for-performance incentive system in place since 2010 that's allowed teachers to get raises more quickly if they performed well on the state's teacher evaluations. Esposito-Visgitis dismissed the evaluations — based on a combination of principal observations, student test scores and school performance — as unfair, inconsistent and ineffective. She and other critics have pointed to studies that suggest teachers who received bonuses do not perform better than those who do not. \"It was unequal from school to school,\" Esposito-Visgitis said. \"It was based on the 'distinguished' rating, and to be honest, at some schools it was easier to get 'distinguished' than others.\" The district will revert to a 12-step salary schedule that bases raises primarily on seniority, with the potential to make more after earning advanced degrees or taking on extra duties like coaching. The stipends for coaches will increase by 12 percent annually, up to $7,474 for the head high school football and basketball coaches and $2,210 for sports like golf and tennis. • New teachers will make more money. The district's starting salary for teachers will increase from roughly $40,000 up to $46,920 next school year and $47,858 in 2019-20, according to Esposito-Visgitis and district documents. The highest-paid (Step 12) teachers will make $90,889 with bachelor's degrees and $95,254 with master's degrees. • Early childhood educators will get a boost, too — but not as much as the union had wanted. \"We wanted parity between the early childhood and classroom teachers,\" Esposito-Visgitis said. \"We certainly didn't get there, but we were able to make some progress.\" Preschool teachers will get 2 percent annual raises through 2020. Their salaries will start at about $36,118 with a bachelor's degree and $37,954 with a master's degree and cap out at $56,000 to $60,000, the agreement shows. • The district must limit mandatory teaching reassignments. Under the tentative contract, the district will be permitted to make 35 involuntary assignments a year to meet shifting school needs, so long as officials follow certain guidelines. Among them: No teacher may be involuntarily assigned more than once in five years, and no more than three teachers from the same school may be involuntarily reassigned in the same year. • Union members are happier with their health care benefits — at least most of them are. The district simplified its offerings to one PPO plan each from UPMC and Highmark. \"Some people got reductions, some people pay more, to even it out,\" Esposito-Visgitis said. \"It'll be a cost-savings to the district, and it's going to be a cost-savings for the majority of our members.\" The contracts are expected to be ratified in final form at a Pittsburgh Public Schools board meeting next week.

         "August Wilson House History Transformation Outreach Shop Donate Attend the August Wilson Birthday Celebration About The Legacy Brick Campaign August Wilson House, the great artist’s childhood home, is opening as an arts center for the Hill—a tribute to his legacy, with a willing heart to nurture artists to come. To do this, it needs more than the welcome contributions of theater stars and Pittsburgh foundations. To make this a real community arts center, we need all who honor August Wilson and his Hill to join in. Add your name or those of your family and friends to the embracing bricks that will help make August Wilson House a home. Legacy bricks cost $100, $250, $500 or $1,000 and will be located in the small patio to the left, along the sidewalk in front, on the path up to the main entrance and at that entrance itself. All the bricks will be limited to up to three lines of text and 14 characters (including spaces and punctuation) per line. Step up now and join the August Wilson House family, so we can get your names on bricks and in place well before the mid-summer House opening! Buy A Brick History THE BEATING HEART OF 1727 BEDFORD AVENUE IS THAT OF AUGUST WILSON. Claim what is yours. Born in 1945, the great playwright spent his first 13 years here with his mother and five siblings, crammed into two rooms (later four). A Jewish family ran a small mom-and-pop store in front, and two Italian brothers repaired shoes and watches next door — Jewish and Italian and Black, the three major groups in the once-multiethnic Hill that turned almost entirely Black after 1968. August Wilson at the side of 1727 Bedford Avenue in 1999. His two-room childhood home is up the stairs at the rear right. However cramped, these small rooms, this house and its yard all pulsed with life. There, August grew up inquisitive, loyal and an incessant reader, to become a Black Nationalist, then poet and playwright. The life nurtured at 1727 Bedford became the passionate heart of his unprecedented American Century Cycle of 10 plays, an epic dramatization of African-American life through a century of comedy and tragedy, aspiration and despair — or as he put it, “love, honor, duty, betrayal.” AUGUST WILSON’S PITTSBURGH August was born into a multiethnic Hill of 55,000 that was one of the nation’s most vibrant Black neighborhoods, with a great Negro League baseball team and enough jazz greats to fill a wing of the hall of fame, all chronicled by the nationally-distributed Pittsburgh Courier, the inimitable Teenie Harris, and eventually August Wilson. “It was on these streets in this community in this city that I came into manhood and I have a fierce affection for the Hill District and the people who raised me.” AUGUST WILSON’S HOUSE Cramped though it was, poor though they were, August said, “I had a wonderful childhood. … As a family, we did things together. … We all sat down and had dinner at a certain time. … We didn’t have a TV, so we listened to the radio.” “The people need to know the story. See how they fit into it. See what part they play.” His youth was shaped here: his mother’s guidance, family gatherings, family fights, neighborhood stories, struggles and successes, and his yearning for knowledge and understanding of the world around him. It all fed his plays: “I happen to think that the content of my mother’s life — her myths, her superstitions, her prayers, the contents of her pantry, the smell of her kitchen, the song that escaped from her sometimes parched lips, her thoughtful repose and pregnant laughter — are all worthy of art.” ↓ TRANSFORMATION The August Wilson House (AWH) was derelict when August visited in 1999 and still derelict when he died in 2005. It quickly became a site of cultural pilgrimage, but those pilgrims saw a wreck. Then Paul Ellis, August’s nephew, formed the Daisy Wilson Artist Community, named for August’s mother. The AWH was landmarked and initial restoration stopped the decay. Eventually Pittsburgh foundations and government supported restoration of the outer shell, and programming began. Our guiding principle comes from August himself, who often said he didn’t want the house to be a museum. If it was going to be preserved, he said, it should be “useful.” Thus our mission: … to celebrate the literary and personal legacy of August Wilson and serve as an arts center to nurture the historic Hill District community and arts practitioners and scholars influenced by his work. The August Wilson House aims first to celebrate the rich store of personal memory and community history into which August dipped the ladle of his transforming art, and second to extend his legacy by advancing the art and culture of the African diaspora and impacting the cultural landscape of the Hill and beyond. The two-room childhood home, restored to its 1950’s period of significance in August’s life, will be revived as an intimate interpretive site, with adjacent rooms housing digital and audio displays and artifacts about his life and plays. Beyond will be a series of small artist studios and community gathering spaces. Outside will be annual productions of the American Century Cycle plays, perhaps growing into a biennial August Wilson Festival. Through August Wilson Visiting Fellowships, both local and national artists and scholars will be provided immersive work, research, and community exchange opportunities in return for partnering with Hill District organizations and Pittsburgh arts groups and universities. Ultimately, the AWH will be a catalyst in the Hill’s re-emergence, linking with other Hill institutions (some being restored themselves) into a network of revival. It is high time the AWH was put to use, as August wanted. PASSING IT FORWARD The heart of the AWH will always be the small family home within the larger house. Combined, they will be a spiritually-rich cultural hub for the Hill and larger Pittsburgh community, offering signature theatrical productions and events, art exhibitions and literary workshops, roundtable discussions and classes in the tradition of the Black Arts Movement. Brought to fruition, the AWH will honor August’s mother, Daisy, who taught him to read when he was four, was disappointed when he dropped out of school but lived to see his first play on stage. As August honored her legacy by passing it forward, so we will do with his. BUILDING THE VISION In planning the transformation of the August Wilson House, the Daisy Wilson Artist Community has developed a number of strategic partnerships that connect the mission of the organization to the Hill’s Master Community Plan and environmental “Green Print” by landscape architect Walter Hood . Integral to this work is engaging youth and neighborhood stakeholders. Examples of strategic partnerships include the Trade Institute of Pittsburgh (construction trades), Carnegie Mellon’s Urban Design Build Studio (preservation technology) and Duquesne University’s Honors College (community engagement and future fellowships). Scaffolding erected in 2016 to begin remainder of exterior construction Draft architectural rendering Performing Space An early fruit of the AWH restoration was this 2016 back- yard production of Seven Guitars, staged in the exact space August describes in the script, drawing on memories of his family life. Shown is the curtain call for the collaboration with Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre, which ran for four weeks to overflow audiences. Outdoor productions of August’s plays will be annual events. ↓ Outreach PROGRAMMING FOR COMMUNITY Central to the AWH will be the two-room family home, supported by displays and interactive opportunities. All this, August would regard as “useful.” Central to the AWH will be the two-room family home, supported by displays and interactive opportunities. All this, August would regard as “useful.” Already creating a strong community identity is the annual August Wilson Birthday Block Party, which has drawn more than 1,000 (and growing) to a festive afternoon of stage and music performances, vendors, food, kids’ games and activities at the nearby August Wilson Park. Bringing his art home will be annual backyard productions of August’s plays, inaugurated by Seven Guitars. Both this and the Block Parties have increased multicultural audiences in the Hill. Nationally, the AWH is a co-sponsor of the August Wilson American Century Cycle Award with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (in consultation with Constanza Romero Wilson), celebrating those theaters that have staged the full 10-play cycle. The August Wilson Visiting Fellows program is being developed on two tracks, collaborating with community arts groups and Pittsburgh universities. Fellows might exhibit work and give community lessons and readings. Ultimately, the AWH hopes also to develop artists’ housing nearby, creating an artistic community to help regenerate the Hill.

Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, “Ice-Cream Joe” Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler Inside Strickler’s Drug Store Outside Strickler’s Drug Store Photos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society Honorary Chair Ice Cream Joe Gruble The legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair. Stay up to date on the latest information.
