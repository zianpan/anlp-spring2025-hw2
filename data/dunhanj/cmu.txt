Changing the way the cookie crumbles It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts.
The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock.
To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful — and it goes beyond selling cookies.

Search Academics Admission About Visit Research Student Experience Athletics Give Rankings College and university rankings continue to proliferate, but their value to individuals and to the institutions remains a subject of some debate.
Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries.
Others make a more serious effort at collecting information.
Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective.
The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent.
For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek.
Those will include some objective information, which you can find on the pages of the Carnegie Mellon University website, or on sites for which CMU provides information, such asIPEDS College Navigatororcollegedata.com.
Your decision should also take into account your own assessment about programs, culture and opportunities for growth.

Search Academics Admission About Visit Research Student Experience Athletics Give Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa.
Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist.
He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.
Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed.
In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities.
"My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto.
The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.
Carnegie Tech – Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge.
Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today.
It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs.
The first U.S.
drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech.
It began offering graduate degrees.
In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China.
It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example.
Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research.
It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society.
Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.
Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech.
In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study.
University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms.
The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948:The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed theDavid A.
Tepper School of Business, focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science.
1968:School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed theH.
John Heinz III College, providing graduate training for work in the public sector.
1986:School of Computer Science, pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.
Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University.
The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons.
It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: theMellon College of Scienceand the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known asMarianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting theshared vision of the foundersand recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.
A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research.
A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration.
Itsalumni can be found across the globe— from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists.
In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh.
Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda.
The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
In the coming years, the university will see thelargest expansionto the Pittsburgh campus since 1900.
At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university.

Search Academics Admission About Visit Research Student Experience Athletics Give Traditions Dating back more than a century, some Carnegie Mellon University traditions have a Scottish flavor (The Kiltie Band) as a nod to founder Andrew Carnegie.
Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence).
Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band — the self-named "Band Without Pants" — has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922.
The Fence The Fenceis painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay.
Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the "most painted object in the world" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence.
Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon's oldest tradition.
Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race "buggies," often reaching up to 35 mph.
Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders — "pushmobiles," as they were called when the tradition started in 1920.
Bagpipers It doesn't get more Scottish than bagpipes.
Carnegie Mellon'sPipes and Drumscan be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events.
Autographs Behind the stage of Kresge Theatre senior "dramats" (dramastudents) sign the walls and ceiling before graduating.
Among these young hopefuls: Ted Danson, Blair Underwood and Holly Hunter.

His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music.
A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.
Changing the way the cookie crumbles It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts.
The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock.
To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful — and it goes beyond selling cookies.
Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject:Women Don't AskandAsk for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want.
Cruise controlled In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute.
Since then, professor and alumnus William "Red" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race.
Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.

Search Academics Admission About Visit Research Student Experience Athletics Give Rankings College and university rankings continue to proliferate, but their value to individuals and to the institutions remains a subject of some debate.
Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries.
Others make a more serious effort at collecting information.
Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective.
The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent.
For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek.
Those will include some objective information, which you can find on the pages of the Carnegie Mellon University website, or on sites for which CMU provides information, such asIPEDS College Navigatororcollegedata.com.
Your decision should also take into account your own assessment about programs, culture and opportunities for growth.

Search Academics Admission About Visit Research Student Experience Athletics Give Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa.
Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist.
He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.
Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed.
In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities.
"My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto.
The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.
Carnegie Tech – Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge.
Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today.
It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs.
The first U.S.
drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech.
It began offering graduate degrees.
In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China.
It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example.
Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research.
It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society.
Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.
Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech.
In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study.
University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms.
The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948:The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed theDavid A.
Tepper School of Business, focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science.
1968:School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed theH.
John Heinz III College, providing graduate training for work in the public sector.
1986:School of Computer Science, pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.
Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University.
The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons.
It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: theMellon College of Scienceand the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known asMarianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting theshared vision of the foundersand recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.
A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research.
A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration.
Itsalumni can be found across the globe— from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists.
In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh.
Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda.
The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
In the coming years, the university will see thelargest expansionto the Pittsburgh campus since 1900.
At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university.
As outlined in theStrategic Plan 2025, the university will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.

Search Academics Admission About Visit Research Student Experience Athletics Give Traditions Dating back more than a century, some Carnegie Mellon University traditions have a Scottish flavor (The Kiltie Band) as a nod to founder Andrew Carnegie.
Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence).
Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band — the self-named "Band Without Pants" — has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922.
The Fence The Fenceis painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay.
Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the "most painted object in the world" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence.
Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon's oldest tradition.
Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race "buggies," often reaching up to 35 mph.
Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders — "pushmobiles," as they were called when the tradition started in 1920.
Bagpipers It doesn't get more Scottish than bagpipes.
Carnegie Mellon'sPipes and Drumscan be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events.
Autographs Behind the stage of Kresge Theatre senior "dramats" (dramastudents) sign the walls and ceiling before graduating.
Among these young hopefuls: Ted Danson, Blair Underwood and Holly Hunter.
