Newsletter Discover Your Persona < Back 15 Foods You Can Only Get in Pittsburgh When you're in Pittsburgh, make sure you eat like the locals do.
Pittsburgh is known for many claims to fame, ranging from oursports teamsto our yellow bridges and iconic rivers, and increasingly for our food scene.
While you're in the Burgh, be sure to check out these foods you'll only be able to find in the Steel City.
Primanti Sandwich No Pittsburgh food list would be complete without mentioningPrimanti Bros..
Primanti's is responsible for arguably Pittsburgh's most famous sandwich ‚Äì their signature offering consisting of grilled meat, melted cheese, oil-and-vinegar based coleslaw, tomato and French fries between Italian bread.
I'd recommend trying one from the original Primanti Bros.
location in theStrip Districtor atPNC Parkwhen you're watching the Buccos play!
My Go-To Order: Capicola, add an egg and lightly hot sauce before enjoying.
Get the pickle on the side.
Pair with an ice cold IC Light.
@nickcourage Pierogies Pierogieshold a near and dear place to many Pittsburghers' hearts.
FromPierogies PlustoCop out Pierogies, thePittsburgh Pierogi Truckand more, there is no shortage of great places for these delicious handmade dumplings.
Pierogis can be found all over Pittsburgh: there's an entire festival devoted to them at Kennywood, mascots donning pierogi costumes race aroundPNC Parkduring all home games, and pierogi t-shirts, earrings and Christmas ornaments are plentiful as you shop around the city.
Let's talk about the Pierogi Pizza.
Combining two long-standing favorite dishes, this delicious 'za is one you have to taste to believe.
One of my favorites is atAiello's PizzainSquirrel Hill.
@pghpierogifestival Looking for more Pittsburgh pierogies?
Check out anentire blogon some of our favorite pierogi spots.
Pittsburgh Salad The French Fries in Pittsburgh don't just stop at sandwiches.
One of my personal favorite meals is the Pittsburgh Salad, featuring French Fries as a topping on a salad as if they were croutons.
It's the best if you're in the mood for something light, but still looking to be filled up.North Park LoungeGrilled Chicken Salad is one of my favorites.
The original North Park Lounge location is near McCandless Crossing but there are several other locations in and around the city so you can't go wrong.
@foodwise47 Potato Patch Fries Then there's The Potato Patch - famous for their French fries alone, without any accompanying sandwich or salad.
Kennywood Park's fresh cut Idaho spuds are some of the most iconic food offering at a theme park you'll find.
Complete with topping choices such as cheddar cheese, bacon, vinegar, brown gravy and seasoning salts,summerjust doesn't feel complete without a stop byThe Potato Patch.
@thefoodiethatcould Gobblerito Here's an Only in Pittsburgh menu item to be thankful for in November ‚Äì the gobblerito.Mad Mexis responsible for this unique meal that manages to fit an entire Thanksgiving dinner in one burrito ‚Äì from the turkey, potatoes, stuffing, complete with a topping of gravy and served with a side of cranberry sauce.
Make sure you don't miss it as it's only available seasonally!
Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte Pittsburgh bakeriesare unlike any other!
From pies to paczki and everything in between, there is no shortage of sweet tooth cravings from our local bakeries.
Be sure to stop byPrantl's Bakeryfor their famousBurnt Almond Torte- you won't be disappointed!
@diaryofatravelingeatie Turner's Tea When I'm visiting friends out of state, you can bet I'm filling a cooler withTurner'sfor them.
Celebrating 50 years, one sip of a Turner's product is enough to turn anyone into a lifelong fan.
Their iced tea, sold in signature orange and yellow cartons, is now a lifestyle as much as a drink with shirts and Turner's merch sold throughout the city.
Their local farm to bottle milk can't be beat, either.
Be sure to follow their Instagram, as collaboration and/or limited time drinks are dropping frequently, and will sell out instantly.
Sarris Candies When you're thinking of a go-to gift for someone you love, it's alwaysSarris Candies.
This local chocolate maker has grown into an empire over their 50+ years in business, and their confections can now be found in 11 states and shipped worldwide.
My Go-To: Their chocolate covered pretzel rods are my favorite, but I'm also a huge fan of the Pittsburgh Pothole Filler (dark chocolate-dunked popcorn).
Smiley Cookies I have more nostalgia for Smiley Cookies than anything on this list.
They remind me of family dinners and treats for doing well in school.
This simple frosted cookie atEat'n Parkhas been a hit with children since 1986, and are given away after each kid's meal ever since.
My Go-To: While Eat'n Park changes up the Smiley Cookies seasonally, make sure to grab the pumpkin decorated ones for fall; those candy corn just hit different.
Oakmonter Pittsburgh knows its desserts.
Right up with there with Prantl's is Oakmont Bakery's aptly namedOakmonter, a vanilla cheesecake and chocolate cake filled with fudge and topped with cherries, buttercream and chocolate bars.
When you bring this to the party or get together, you instantly become everyone's friend.
Gobs Pamela's Hotcakes Make your way toPamela's Dinerand order the paper-thin, crepe-like hotcakes for a delicious breakfast you won't soon forget.
Order the hotcakes filled with fruit and brown sugar, topped with whipped cream, or drizzled with syrup.
Heinz Ketchup This iconic, world-renowned condiment was created in Pittsburgh in 1857.Heinzramped up production of the tomato ketchup during the 20th century.
As of today, the ketchup is no longer produced in the city, but it is still a popular condiment at local restaurants and residents' homes.
@photo.krugh Pepperoni Roll A simple, but incredibly tasty and satisfying baked good, pepperoni rolls came to Pittsburgh in the early 1900s as a means to feed hungry coal miners.
Pepperoni rolls have become such a staple in the city you can find them at many of the bakeries in the city including Mancini's Bakery in the Strip District and Colangelo‚Äôs Bakery & Caf√©.
Visit Rolling Pepperoni for classic pepperoni rolls as well asvegetarian and vegan options.
@mancinisbread Beto's Raw Pizza Have you ever had a pizza covered in cold toppings?
The only cooked parts of Beto's raw pizza are the crust and sauce meaning each pizza is served with mounds of uncooked cheese and a variety of cold, classic pizza toppings.
Take a bite as soon as it's served to enjoy the contrast between the hot crust and cold toppings or wait a few minutes and let the cheese melt a little, either way this is a style of pizza all pizza lovers should try.

Newsletter Discover Your Persona < Back Food at the Confluence Nestled in the Allegheny Mountain range, at the confluence of the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio rivers, lies a unique city.
With blue collar roots that run deep, and a modern renaissance looking toward a future of innovation and technology, Pittsburgh is a model of resilience.
Pittsburgh has an extensive history as a place for immigrants to establish themselves in the United States.
The industrial history of the city meant attracting workers from across the world to work in the steel mills and coal mines of the surrounding area ‚Äî workers who helped turn Pittsburgh into the city that built America.
With a history rooted in the traditional European foods of pierogies, stews and pastas, today the international dishes of the city also include curries, steaming bowls of ramen or pho, and nkwobi.
Bar menus have expanded from the Iron City pint to lists of Mexican mezcals, Japanese whiskeys and Italian amaros.
Food in the Steel City has changed drastically and continues to evolve at a rapid pace.
But while tastes have continued to evolve, one thing remains constant ‚Äî Pittsburghers‚Äô general love of food!
Portion sizes here lean toward the Midwest, which guarantees patrons will never leave a restaurant hungry.
Whether a Pittsburgher is watching a Sunday game at their friend‚Äôs place or having a date night out on the town, food is always front and center.
While we cannot ignore the quantity of food available in Pittsburgh, perhaps the more important thing to highlight is the actual quality of food in the city.
Restaurants all over the City of Bridges make it a point to use local ingredients and purveyors, helping to support the regional economy.
Nationally acclaimed chef Justin Severino openedMorcillaas a tapas restaurant in Lawrenceville in 2016 and was immediately a James Beard semifinalist for Best New Restaurant in the country.
Using local ingredients as much as possible, his team has carefully curated a tapas experience that will transport you to Spain.
Be sure to try the house-made charcuterie!
Credit | Pittsburgh restaurant groups like big Burrito and the Richard DeShantz Restaurant Group continue to open concepts that push boundaries.
The highly anticipated recent opening ofSally Ann‚Äôs, a casual dining restaurant from Richard Deshantz with a killer brunch menu, gives diners a unique, fun option in the Cultural District.
For drinks, enjoy cocktails atBridges & Bourbonbefore seeing a show in the Cultural District.
As its name suggests, its extensive liquor selection puts bourbon, whiskey and rye front and center.
And in a cozy, elegant environment, it‚Äôs perfect for kicking off a date night.
La Palapa serves up some of the best Mexican food in the city and features a bar list sure to impress the mezcal drinker.
Don‚Äôt miss any of the breweries helping to transform Pittsburgh into a beer drinker‚Äôs paradise, either.
Somehow, craft beer tastes better when sipped under the stained glass of a historic church atThe Church Brew Works.
Enjoy an icy pint in the biergarten atPenn Breweryor sip an American pale ale in the taproom atDancing Gnome.
To enjoy the crisp apples of fall all year round, visitArsenal Cider Housefor hard cider tastings.
Credit | For Asian flavors, try the city‚Äôs newest Cantonese restaurant,The Parlor Dim Sum, or enjoy Sichuan-style menus atChengdu GourmetorSichuan Gourmet.Everyday Noodles‚Äô soup dumplings are easily the best crafted in any of the ‚ÄòBurgh‚Äôs neighborhoods, served in the traditional bamboo steam baskets with a burst of scalding pork broth when bitten.Pho Vanin the Strip District features traditional Vietnamese pho with a rich depth of flavor to the broth that‚Äôs hard to beat.
Try the South Indian dish, Goat Briyani, atTamarind, or savor the chaats atCafe Delhi.
If Mediterranean food sounds better, enjoyTurkish Kebab Housein Squirrel Hill or the charming basement Italian bistro,Girasole, in Shadyside.
Enjoy traditional West African dishes atAfrican Cuisine, where the menu features Nigerian recipes from the owners‚Äô homeland.
Credit | The Strip District still boasts classic food markets likeWholey‚Äôs Fish Market,S&D Polish DeliandPennsylvania Macaroni Company.
But be sure to also take a look atPennsylvania Libations, a liquor store dedicated to selling and supporting Pennsylvania-made craft beverages.Salem‚Äôs Market and Grillfurther into the Strip District is a great place for any Halal needs.

In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion was in full force because of farmers rebelling against the whisky task which in return made western Pennsylvania a hub for a lot of distilleries during that time.
This changed when prohibition came into effect where it made it illegal to produce and sell alcohol.Fast forward to the year 2000, when the whole state of Pennsylvania had only one distillery.
Today, there are around 70 in the state with more than a dozen of those located in Allegheny County.
