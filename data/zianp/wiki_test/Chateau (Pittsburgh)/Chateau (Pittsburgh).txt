Chateau is a North Side neighborhood in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 6 (North Shore/Downtown Neighborhoods). It is on the banks of the Ohio River and is separated from the neighborhood of Manchester by PA Route 65.

As of the 2000 U.S. census, Chateau has a population of 39. A 2006 investigation by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found the neighborhood virtually uninhabited.  This may be because the neighborhood mostly consists of warehouses and places of business along the Ohio River.

In August 2009, the Rivers Casino opened along the Ohio River in the Chateau neighborhood. Kamin Science Center and the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild are also located in Chateau. Chateau has a Zip Code of 15233.

Chateau has four land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Manchester to the north and north-northeast,  
Allegheny West to the northeast, North Shore to the east, and Marshall-Shadeland to the northwest.  Across the Ohio River, Chateau runs adjacent with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of (from northwest to southeast) Esplen, Elliott, West End Valley (with direct link via West End Bridge) and the South Shore
