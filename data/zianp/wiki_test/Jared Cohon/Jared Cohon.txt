Jared Leigh Cohon (October 7, 1947 – March 16, 2024) was an American academic administrator who served as the eighth president of Carnegie Mellon University beginning 1997 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. As of 2014[update] he was a University Professor in the Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering.

Jared Leigh Cohon was born in Cleveland, Ohio on October 7, 1947. He held a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and MS and PhD degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earned in 1972 and 1973, respectively.

He became President of Carnegie Mellon in 1997. During his first month of his presidency, he oversaw the removal of a stand of trees to build the Purnell Center for the Arts. He was shocked that there were no student protests against the act.
"I'm worried that our undergraduates can be so focused on preparing for their careers that they fail to develop a sense of and passion for what else is important to them." –Jared Cohon, 1997 copy of The Thistle, Carnegie Mellon's now defunct yearbook
Cohon stepped down from his position as President of Carnegie Mellon in 2013 and returned to the faculty as a University Professor in the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Engineering and Public Policy and director of the Wilton E.
