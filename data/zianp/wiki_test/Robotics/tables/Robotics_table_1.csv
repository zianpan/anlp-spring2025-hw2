Third century B.C. and earlier,"One of the earliest descriptions of automata appears in the Lie Zi text, on a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou (1023–957 BC) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. The latter allegedly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork.[165]",,Yan Shi (Chinese: 偃师)

1898,Nikola Tesla demonstrates the first radio-controlled vessel.,Teleautomaton,Nikola Tesla
1903,"Leonardo Torres Quevedo presented the Telekino at the Paris Academy of Science, a radio-based control system with different operational states, for testing airships without risking human lives.[169] He conduct the initial test controlling a tricycle almost 100 feet away, being the first example of a radio-controlled unmanned ground vehicle.[170][171]",Telekino,Leonardo Torres Quevedo
1912,"Leonardo Torres Quevedo builds the first truly autonomous machine capable of playing chess. As opposed to the human-operated The Turk and Ajeeb, El Ajedrecista had an integrated automaton built to play chess without human guidance. It only played an endgame with three chess pieces, automatically moving a white king and a rook to checkmate the black king moved by a human opponent.[172][173]",El Ajedrecista,Leonardo Torres Quevedo
1914,"In his paper Essays on Automatics published in 1914, Leonardo Torres Quevedo proposed a machine that makes ""judgments"" using sensors that capture information from the outside, parts that manipulate the outside world like arms, power sources such as batteries and air pressure, and most importantly, captured information and past information. It was defined as an organism that can control reactions in response to external information and adapt to changes in the environment to change its behavior.[174][175][176][177]",Essays on Automatics,Leonardo Torres Quevedo

1961,"First installed industrial robot. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them.",Unimate,George Devol
1967 to 1972,"First full-scale humanoid intelligent robot,[180][181] and first android. Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with its hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes, and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.[182][183][184]",WABOT-1,Waseda University
1973,First industrial robot with six electromechanically driven axes[185][186],Famulus,KUKA Robot Group

1978,"The first object-level robot programming language, RAPT, allowing robots to handle variations in object position, shape, and sensor noise.[187]",Freddy I and II,Patricia Ambler and Robin Popplestone
1983,"First multitasking, the parallel programming language used for robot control. It was the Event Driven Language (EDL) on the IBM/Series/1 process computer, with the implementation of both inter-process communication (WAIT/POST) and mutual exclusion (ENQ/DEQ) mechanisms for robot control.[188]",ADRIEL I,Stevo Bozinovski and Mihail Sestakov
