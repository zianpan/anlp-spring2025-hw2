The Association of Independent Technological Universities (AITU) is a group of private American engineering colleges established in 1957. The purpose of the association is to share ideas and practices that promote innovation and entrepreneurship, promote technology-oriented careers and advance post-secondary education in engineering and science.

The Association of Independent Technological Universities was founded by fifteen colleges. Since then, two of the original institutions have left the association (after having expanded from their original scope as technological universities) and many of the remaining thirteen have undergone name changes and/or mergers. In addition, nine more colleges have joined the association for a total of twenty-two current members.
