The Allegheny County district attorney is the elected district attorney for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The office is responsible for the prosecution of violations of Pennsylvania commonwealth laws (federal law violations are prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania). The current district attorney is Stephen Zappala.

In 1995, the assistant district attorneys formed a collective bargaining unit and voted to be represented by the United Steelworkers of America. The bargaining unit also represents assistant public defenders and scientists in the coroner's office (now the Office of Medical Examiner) and computer professionals in the prothonotary's office (now the Department of Court Records).
