The flag of Pittsburgh is the official municipal flag of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a vertical bicolor triband of black and gold with the municipal coat of arms in the center.

In 2004, the flag was ranked as the twenty-fourth best flag design out of 150 city flags by the North American Vexillological Association, and was the top-rated tricolor.

In tribute to the flag, all four professional athletic teams in Pittsburgh in the sports of baseball, football, hockey, and soccer are black and gold. The arms are based on those of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, namesake of the city.
