The Wood Street Galleries, a visual arts project of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, is an art gallery that is located in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The gallery occupies the upper floors of the Max Azen company building, above the Wood Street light rail stop.

The triangular-shaped building that houses the gallery was transferred to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust in 1990 by the Pittsburgh Port Authority Transit, for the sum of $1 per year. The Wood Street Galleries were established two years later in 1992.

This gallery focuses on contemporary and technological art.
