HANNAH EISENDLE: Heliosis [PSO Premiere]
LISZT: Piano Concerto No. 2
IMAN HABIBI: "Jeder Baum spricht" [PSO Premiere]
BEETHOVEN: Symphony No. 6, "Pastoral"

About this Performance
The PSO’s season features works inspired by the natural world: Beethoven’s “Pastoral” you can hear bucolic bird calls, the rolling of thunder, and the calling of a shepherd’s pipes from distant hills. Habibi’s new work was written as a meditation on climate change. Eisendle’s Heliosis, from the Greek word for the sun, is in turn blistering, scorching, and shimmering.

Symphony Starter
Just starting with the symphony? We welcome you! Symphony Starters are concerts that feature our most popular programming and enhancements that make Heinz Hall even more special; like signature cocktails, meeting PSO musicians, and learning more about the music you hear.
