Voice Lesson – A voice lesson led by a member of Pittsburgh Opera. Children will learn about different voice types, how to use proper breath support, how to project their voices, and more.
Fukuwarai – Play a traditional Japanese New Year’s celebration game that is a bit like pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and definitely just as silly and fun!
Costume Activity – Make your very own accessories – butterfly headbands or Pikachu ears! – to finalize your look and get ready to go out on stage.
Participants will rotate throughout the four activities. Each participant and group will participate in all four activities. There is no minimum age to attend.

March 10, 2025
6:00 PM-8:30 PM
  Ceremony
The tea ceremony, or Chado (The Way of Tea), is a traditional Japanese art involving the ritualistic preparation of tea. Influenced by the philosophy of Zen Buddhism, the core teaching of chado is to attain a spiritual state of selflessness and peacefulness through making and sharing tea. Join us to learn the history and philosophy of Japanese tea ceremony while tasting Japanese tea and sweets.

Yuko Eguchi is a native of Tokyo, Japan and holds a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from the University of Pittsburgh. She received her tea master title and name, Soyu, in 2009 and the associate professor of tea title in 2013, certified by the head master of the Urasenke school. Yuko has performed and lectured on Japanese traditional arts at various higher institutions.

Recital
Japanese mezzo-soprano, Nozomi Kato, is in demand at leading opera houses in Italy, Spain, Japan and beyond. In particular, she has made a name for herself internationally as Suzuki in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, which she will perform at Pittsburgh Opera in March of 2025 reprising her role in a production originated at Cincinnati Opera (dir: Matthew Ozawa).

  Panel Discussion: Women’s Role in Tech, Video Games, Anime, Manga, and Comic Books
East Liberty branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
March 13, 2025
6:30 PM-7:30 PM
  Join us at CLP for a free panel discussion with RAD Pass participating organization Pittsburgh Opera where we will explore Women’s Role in Video Games, Anime, Manga, and Comic Books.  Women have often been unrealistically represented in these art forms leading to detrimental outcomes in the real world. This discussion aims to unpack the origins of female representation in art and explore the fine line between fandom and fetish.
  Pittsburgh Opera leads this discussion in anticipation of its groundbreaking new production of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly. Created by an all-Japanese and Japanese American creative team, the story is set in a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect. The male protagonist, Pinkerton, puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry Cio-Cio San, his fantasy girl, and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real.
  Attendees receive a discounted ticket offer to the performance of Madama Butterfly of their choice (March 22nd, 25th, 28th, and 30th) and will be entered into a raffle to receive a pair of free tickets. All performances of Madama Butterfly will take place downtown at the Benedum Center.
  NO REGISTRATION NEEDED!
