    "The precision issue you ran into is really interesting—it's one of those subtle but critical details that can easily go unnoticed. Normalizing ranks after each iteration seems like a solid fix to maintain correctness.\n",

    "Your performance optimization steps are also great takeaways. Caching while carefully unpersisting previous iterations is a smart way to balance memory usage, and tuning Spark’s configuration can make a huge difference in execution time. It’s impressive that you took the time to experiment with different parameters in run.sh—those small tweaks can be the key to meeting performance targets. Definitely a valuable learning experience for handling large-scale graph processing in the cloud!"
